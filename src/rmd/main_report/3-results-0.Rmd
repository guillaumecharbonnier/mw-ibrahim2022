# Results

Datasets are first explored separately in the two following subsections, then integrative approaches are applied. Note the microarrays are referred to by the GSE id, while the RNA-Seq are referred to by their SRP id. While RNA-Seq also have GSE id, the use of distinct ids make the distinction clearer.

```{r results}
dea_res <- list(
  microarray = list(),
  rnaseq = list(),
  microarray_v2 = list() # microarray using reannotations from Biomart instead of the original author ones
)

norm_signal <- list(
  microarray = list(),
  rnaseq = list()
)
```
